Spectral clustering using the Bethe Hessian matrix
Companion paper: "Spectral Clustering of Graphs with the Bethe Hessian", submitted to NIPS 2014.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

demo_sbm.m performs clustering on synthetic graphs generated by the stochastic block model. Available methods include the Bethe Hessian, the non-bactracking matrix, the adjacency matrix, and the symmetrically normalized Laplacian. Type help demo_sbm in Matlab to see usage. 

demo_real_world_BH.m performs clustering based on the Bethe Hessian on the real world networks included in the paper. The user can add any other network in gml format in the real_world_networks folder. Type help demo_real_world_BH in Matlab to see usage.

Any comments or suggestions would be highly appreciated : alaa.saade@lps.ens.fr
